# StoicApp

## Getting started

* First, ensure that node.js & npm are both installed. If not, choose your OS and installation method from [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and follow the instructions.
* Next, use your command line to enter your project directory.
* This repo comes with a ready-to-use package file called `package.json`. You just need to run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies into your project.
* When `npm` has finished with the install, run `npm run build` to generate the output files into the `dist` folder.

You're ready to go! The most useful task for rapid development is `npm start`. It will start a new server, open up a browser and watch for any SCSS or JS changes; once it compiles those changes, the browser will automatically inject the changed file(s)!
